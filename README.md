# Overview of VS Code Documentation for Beginner
Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This documentation will guide you through essential techniques to boost your productivity in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The goal of this documentation is to provide you with the information needed to build a productive development environment. It also introduces features that can further optimize your development process.

These are the topics of this document 
* Connecting to GitHub
* Debugging
* Editing Code Efficiently

## How We Collaborated
To establish our topic and allocate roles, our team held in-person meetings. Collaboration on the documentation was managed through Git and GitHub, while Discord served as our platform to discuss progress, review deliverables, and exchange feedback.

## How We Created Out Guide
Our guide was created using the knowledge we gained during CST Term 1 while working with VS Code. We meticulously followed our guidelines within VS Code and documented each step in detail. By encountering and resolving potential errors and troubleshooting issues firsthand, we were able to offer practical solutions throughout the guide.

### Using MKDocs
We chose to use MkDocs, as introduced in COMM 2116. The appearance of the Material for MkDocs theme was clean and organized, making it an excellent choice for our workflow.

### Using Markdown
This documentation represents our first experience with Markdown. We learned how to style text using Markdown techniques in our COMM 2116 Business Communications 2 class and enhanced our skills by applying these techniques throughout the documentation process.

### Using VS Code
We used VS Code to write our Markdown files. While we relied on its built-in preview for quick feedback, We deployed our guide using MkDocs to verify that our styles appeared exactly as intended.

### Best Practices for Web Documentation

Consistency and Style:

Our documentation maintains a unified appearance by consistently formatting actionable verbs in bold blue text and displaying commands in dedicated code blocks. This approach makes it clear what actions to take.


Visual Aids:

We use screenshots and images (figures) to support our instructions, helping you follow each step effectively.


Tone:

Our documentation is written in a friendly, casual tone that minimizes technical jargon, making it easy for beginners to follow while still offering clear and useful instructions for experienced developers.

## Conclusion
This documentation encapsulates our process of mastering VS Code integration with GitHub, effective debugging, and efficient code editing. While we continue to expand our expertise in these tools, creating this guide has helped us develop clear, web-friendly instructions designed to assist others in enhancing their workflows.

This project also served as a test of our collaborative abilities. Throughout our work, we maintained constant communication, frequently sharing progress updates and ensuring a consistent style. Our teamwork enabled us to overcome challenges and refine our approach.

Thank you for reviewing our VS Code documentation. We hope it serves as a practical resource for your development work and as a reference for our future projects.
