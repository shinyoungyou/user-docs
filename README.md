# Overview of VS Code User Documentation

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This documentation will guide you with clear steps on how to use important features in [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code). VS Code is a simple but powerful editor used for writing and debugging code.

Our goal is to help you use VS Code easily. Youâ€™ll learn how to connect to GitHub, debug your Python code, and edit your files quickly.

This guide covers these topics:

- Connecting to GitHub
- Debugging Python code
- Editing code faster

## How We Collaborated

Our team started by meeting in person to choose topics and plan the project. We used **Git** and **GitHub** to manage our work and avoid conflicts. We talked regularly on **Discord** to share ideas and check our progress.

## How We Created This Guide

We made this guide based on what we learned from our CST Term 1 classes, such as COMP1537 Web Development and COMP1800 Project 1, where we often used VS Code. We wrote down each step clearly as we practiced, noting problems and their solutions.

### Using MkDocs

We chose [**MkDocs**](https://www.mkdocs.org/) as our style theme to build our documentation website. We liked [**Material for MkDocs**](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) because it was easy to style and made our guide look neat.

### Using Markdown

Writing this guide was our first big project using Markdown. We practiced Markdown skills learned from our COMM 2116 class, making sure our writing was clear and easy to follow.

### Using VS Code

We wrote everything directly in VS Code. We used the built-in preview to check our Markdown first, then used MkDocs to make sure everything looked good online.

### Using a Style Guide

To make sure our writing was consistent, important actions were shown in **bold**, commands were put inside `code blocks`, and pictures helped show each step.

We also used special messages called admonitions to point out important things clearly:

!!! warning
    Be careful! This step can cause errors.

!!! note
    Extra tips or helpful information.

!!! success
    Shows that you followed the steps correctly.

## Best Practices for Web Documentation

### Readability

Our guide is easy to read because we used short sections with clear titles. Every section starts with a short overview and ends with a summary to help readers understand quickly.

### Chunking

We divided information into smaller parts to avoid confusion. Clear headings, pictures, and GIF animations help you follow along step-by-step.

### Tone

We wrote this guide in a friendly way so itâ€™s easy to understand for beginners. Difficult words were avoided, and we included links for words that might need extra explanation.

## Conclusion

Creating this guide helped us learn more about VS Code and how to explain things clearly. We improved our teamwork and learned how to write documentation that's easy to read on the web.

Thanks for reading our VS Code documentation! We hope it helps you work faster and easier.
