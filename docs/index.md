# Introduction

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This documentation will guide you through essential features of [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code), a powerful and popular code editor designed for building and debugging modern web and software applications.

Our goal is to help you effectively utilize VS Code's debugging tools, seamlessly integrate your work with GitHub for collaboration, and optimize your coding workflow with powerful editing features and shortcuts.

> [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an open-source, lightweight, and highly customizable code editor developed by Microsoft. It supports various languages and frameworks, provides built-in support for Git and debugging, and has an extensive library of extensions that enhance productivity.

## Intended Users

This guide is intended for:

- Beginner to intermediate developers who want to enhance their coding efficiency and learn best practices for debugging and code management.
- Developers transitioning from other editors or IDEs who wish to quickly get up to speed with VS Code's key functionalities.
- Beginner developers who use Windows and want to connect VS Code to GitHub for collaborating efficiently with others.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

This documentation assumes you have:

- Basic familiarity with programming concepts (e.g., loops, arrays).
- A foundational understanding of version control systems, specifically Git.
- Familiarity with Python and have the Python extension installed in VS Code.
- Have used Python in the VS Code environment before.
- Frontend experience with HTML.
