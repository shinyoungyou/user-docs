# Introduction

Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This documentation will guide you through essential features of [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VS Code), a powerful and popular code editor designed for building and debugging modern web and software applications.

Our goal is to help you effectively utilize VS Code's debugging tools, seamlessly integrate your work with GitHub for collaboration, and optimize your coding workflow with powerful editing features and shortcuts.

> [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is an open-source, lightweight, and highly customizable code editor developed by Microsoft. It supports various languages and frameworks, provides built-in support for Git and debugging, and has an extensive library of extensions that enhance productivity.

## Intended Users

This guide is intended for:

- Developers who are already using VS Code and want to make better use of VS Code features.
- Users looking to improve their coding efficiency by learning best practices for debugging and code management in VS Code.
- Beginner to intermediate Python developers on Windows who want to work more efficiently using GitHub and VS Code.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

This documentation assumes you have:

- A basic understanding of programming concepts (e.g., loops, arrays).
- Experience working with Python, including using it within the VS Code environment.
- The Python extension installed in VS Code.
- Knowledge of how to open a project folder and create new files in VS Code.
- Understanding of how to configure the Python debugger in VS Code.
- Basic frontend development experience with HTML.
- A GitHub account and foundational knowledge of Git/version control systems.

|Instructions that require you to run a command in terminal| <blockquote>run some command in the terminal |


## Admonitions
This guide uses success, warning, and note messages to provide additional information for instruction steps.

!!! warning
    Warning provides information about instructions that can cause errors.

!!! note
    Note provides additional information for a step.

!!! success
    Success provides information about the success outcome of instructions.
